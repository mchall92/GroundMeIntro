        <p>GroundMe is an Android app that helps users address the 
          problem of acute stress and anxiety. It uses a set of 
          interactive exercises/games designed to ground users into 
          the present moment to redirect negative or spiraling thoughts. </p>
          <p>This app lets users create an account through Firebase and 
            allows users to log their stress/anxiety events from our 
            trigger tracker. We store usersâ€™ triggers on 
            <b>Firebase Realtime Database </b> (NoSQL)
            and keep track of when and where the user 
            needs to use the app. For example, if the user approaches 
            places or times that have caused anxiety in the past, the 
            app sends a notification to check in on them</p>
            <p>
              For the purpose of this project, we also built two 
              activities to interact with users: 
            </p>
          <p><b>Marble Game:</b></p>
          <p> 
            The goal of this small game is to roll a marble through 
            a maze and into a target hole. There are barriers between 
            the start point for the marble and the target hole. This 
            activity makes use of the accelerometer sensors to determine 
            the direction and acceleration of the marble. Size of the
          maze is dynamically determinted based on screen size.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Painting:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The user sees a white rectangle and a short prompt 
              (e.g., draw an object close to you). The user can then 
              select a color and use their finger to draw on the canvas. 
              Prompts are generated randomly to increase interactions 
              with users.
            </p>
            <p>All tasks that takes more than a few milliseconds 
              are placed in background threads to avoid blocking the
            UI thread.</p>
            <p>Finally, our application was designed following 
              <b>agile development, Android quality guidelines</b>
              and tested under <b>Android StrictMode</b>.
